Where users can browse products, add them into a Shopping Cart, checkout items and make payments.

# Technical requirements

We had to take consideration the following requirements:
- Work with GIT flow.
- Use JDBC for the database access.
- Use the database through the DAO pattern (Data Access Object).
- Suggested (though not required) to cover the new code with tests.
- Use advanced OOP concepts:
- Use inheritance
- Write at least one Abstract class
- Implement at least one Interface
- It's not required to integrate real payment services 

# Install & Usage the App

1. Import this project to IntelliJ as a Maven project. (IntelliJ can auto-install the dependencies from the pom.xml)
2. Fill resources/connection/connection.properties config file with your database's properties
3. `run Main.java`
4. In your browser, type `localhost:8888`

#  Usage the Test

In test/java/com/codecool/shop there are two different folders. 
You can just simply `run JunitTestRunner`
